# MS-thesis
This project was my Masterâ€™s thesis. It was an effort to gauge the infiltration of BOTs in different popularity metrics on Twitter. There were two major components 1) Training A classifier for BOT detection 2) Finding the frequency of BOTS in the set of followers of famous politicians and the set of re-tweeters of famous Pakistani political hashtags on Twitter in 2017. For BOT detection 26 hand crafted features were used. A large dataset was prepared for the detection of bots in followers and famous hashtags. Random forest gave 95% accuracy on the crafted features.
